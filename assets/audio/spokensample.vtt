00:00.000 --> 00:02.300
While working as a full stack intern at Flexport, 

00:02.301 --> 00:06.240
I had the opportunity to develop my communication skills by gathering requirements 

00:06.241 --> 00:09.510
from my manager, product managers, and senior developers 

00:09.511 --> 00:12.690
to iteratively evolve a featureâ€™s design and implementation. 

00:12.691 --> 00:17.200
An especially difficult challenge came in the form of gathering authentication requirements, 

00:17.201 --> 00:22.520
as Flexport was undergoing a bit of a shift at the time towards a more role based access control scheme. 

00:22.520 --> 00:26.080
There was much conflicting information to parse through from 

00:26.080 --> 00:29.250
internal guides, manager suggestions, developer insights, 

00:29.250 --> 00:34.250
product manager perspectives, and of course Identity and Access Management protocols. 

00:34.250 --> 00:39.580
The result was not only a new feature with correctly configured access, 

00:39.580 --> 00:45.300
but also a better understanding of the desired authentication practices by myself and my team.
